## 👩‍💻 About Me

I am a final year Information Technology student at **VSSUT Burla**, passionate about Data Analytics and User Experience Design.

I enjoy exploring SQL for data handling and cleaning, and designing engaging digital experiences using Figma and Canva. I am also dedicated to improving my problem-solving skills through Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

Currently, my focus is on building a hands-on portfolio that showcases real-world projects in both analytics and design.
