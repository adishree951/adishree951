## About Me

I am a final year Information Technology student at VSSUT Burla with a growing interest in Data Analytics and User Experience Design.  

I enjoy exploring SQL for data handling and cleaning, as well as creating meaningful digital experiences using design tools like Figma and Canva. Currently, I am also developing my problem-solving skills through Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

My focus is on building a portfolio that reflects practical, real-world projects in both analytics and design.
